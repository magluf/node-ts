## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was born out of learning hunger and to also implement a good starting point for Node.js apps with some other flavours in it (for now, just TypeScript and MongoDB.)

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js v12.x

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
